# Design: Static HTML Mocks

This directory contains static, non-functional HTML and CSS mockups that serve as the visual blueprint for the `Alignment` user interface.

These files are used as a concrete reference for building the final React components. They define the structure, layout, and core styling of the application.

## How to View the Mocks

These are static files, so you can open them directly in your browser. However, for the best experience (and for CSS/image paths to work correctly), it's recommended to serve them with a simple local web server.

1.  **Navigate to this directory** in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd design
    ```

2.  **Start a local server.** If you have Python 3 installed, this is the easiest way:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
    *(If you use Node.js, you can use `npx serve`)*

3.  **Open your browser** and go to:
    [**http://localhost:8000**](http://localhost:8000)

You will see a directory listing. Click on any `.html` file to view the mock.
