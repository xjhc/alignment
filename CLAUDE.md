# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Alignment** is a corporate-themed social deduction game where humans identify a rogue AI among them before it converts staff and seizes company control. This is a **Go monorepo** in the design phase - source code is not yet implemented, only comprehensive documentation exists.

## Architecture & Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go with supervised Actor Model architecture
- **Frontend**: Hybrid Go/WebAssembly + React/TypeScript application
- **Database**: Redis (Write-Ahead Log and state snapshots)
- **Build**: Vite for frontend, standard Go toolchain for backend
- **Deployment**: Single VM deployment model

## Development Commands

**Note**: The actual source code has not been implemented yet. These are the planned commands once implementation begins:

### Backend (Go)
```bash
# Start backend server (when implemented)
cd server/
go run ./cmd/server/

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...

# Linting and formatting
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
golangci-lint run

# Generate coverage report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Frontend (React + Go/Wasm)
```bash
# Start frontend dev server (when implemented)
cd client/
npm install
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Dependencies
```bash
# Start Redis (required for backend)
redis-server
```


## Development guidelines

This codebase prioritizes **maintainability and performance** through clean, idiomatic Go and modern frontend practices. When generating or modifying code, adhere strictly to these principles:

* Simplicity and Conciseness: Write the most straightforward code possible. Avoid overly clever or "magic" solutions. Code should be dense with meaning, not with characters.
* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Every function, struct, and package should have one, and only one, reason to change. Decompose complex logic into smaller, focused units.
* Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): Aggressively refactor to eliminate duplicated code. Use functions and shared modules to promote reuse.
* Testability: Code must be structured to be easily testable. This often means preferring pure functions and using interfaces for dependencies.
* No Technical Debt: We adhere to the "Boy Scout Rule"â€”always leave the code cleaner than you found it. Do not defer refactoring or implement temporary hacks. Choose the correct, maintainable solution now, even if it takes longer.
* Documentation as Code: Documentation must be kept up-to-date. If a code change alters a feature, API, or architectural pattern, the corresponding documentation in the /docs directory must be updated within the same commit or pull request. Treat documentation with the same rigor as source code.

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Actor Model Implementation
- Each game runs in dedicated goroutine with in-memory `GameState`
- All game events processed serially through Go channels (no locks needed)
- Supervisor pattern provides fault isolation - single game crashes don't affect server
- Central Dispatcher routes WebSocket messages to correct actor channels

### State Management
- **In-Memory**: Live games hold complete state in memory for performance
- **Redis WAL**: All events appended to Redis Streams for durability
- **Snapshots**: Periodic full state saves to Redis keys
- **Recovery**: Fast startup by loading snapshot + replaying recent events

### AI Architecture (Hybrid Brain)
- **Rules Engine**: Deterministic Go rules engine for game decisions
- **Language Model**: Large Language Model for human-like communication only
- **MCP Interface**: Model Context Protocol for secure AI-game communication

### Frontend Hybrid Design
- **Go/Wasm Core**: Client-side game logic and WebSocket management
- **React Shell**: UI rendering and user interaction handling
- **Bridge Layer**: JavaScript connects Wasm and React components

## Testing Strategy

### Coverage Requirements
- **Core Logic**: 95% unit test coverage for `ApplyEvent` and `RulesEngine` functions
- **Integration**: Actor black-box testing with mocked dependencies
- **System**: Supervisor resilience and failure scenario testing

### Test Patterns
```go
// Table-driven tests for pure functions
func TestApplyEvent(t *testing.T) {
    testCases := []struct {
        name          string
        initialState  GameState
        event         Event
        expectedState GameState
    }{
        // Test cases here
    }
}

// Actor integration tests with mocks
func TestActor_PlayerJoinsAndVotes(t *testing.T) {
    mockStore := &MockDataStore{}
    actor := NewGameActor("test-game", mockStore)
    // Send actions and assert on mock calls
}
```

## Project Structure (Planned)

## Current Status

This repository is in **design and documentation phase**. All architecture has been planned and documented, but no Go/React source code exists yet. The next development phase will implement the documented specifications.
