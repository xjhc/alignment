# Race Condition Fix Verification

## The Problem
Previously, when Player 4 joined a lobby with 3 existing players, they would see an empty lobby initially because:

1. **HTTP Request**: REST API returns `player_id` and `session_token`
2. **Client**: Immediately connects WebSocket
3. **WebSocket Handler**: Sends `SendCurrentStateToPlayer` message to LobbyActor
4. **LobbyManager**: Sends `AddPlayer` message to LobbyActor (asynchronously)
5. **Race Condition**: If step 3 happens before step 4, Player 4 gets the old state

## The Solution
Now the flow is:

1. **HTTP Request**: REST API adds player to lobby state **synchronously**
2. **REST API**: Tells LobbyActor to broadcast the update
3. **Client**: Connects WebSocket with guaranteed-correct state
4. **WebSocket Handler**: LobbyActor sends current state (which is now correct)

## Key Changes

### LobbyManager.JoinLobby()
```go
// --- THE CRITICAL FIX ---
// Directly modify the lobby state. This is safe due to the manager's lock.
lobby.Players = append(lobby.Players, playerInfo)

// Now, tell the actor to simply broadcast its new state.
actor.BroadcastLobbyUpdate()
```

### LobbyActor
- **REMOVED**: `AddPlayerInfo` message type and `handlePlayerJoined` method
- **ADDED**: `BroadcastUpdate` message type for simple broadcasting
- **SIMPLIFIED**: Actor only handles broadcasts and state sending, not state modification

### Result
- **No Race Condition**: Player state is updated before HTTP response returns
- **Guaranteed Correct State**: WebSocket connection always sees the right lobby state
- **Atomic Operations**: Player addition happens under lock in single location

## Verification
Both backend and frontend compile successfully, and actor tests pass.
Player 4 should now immediately see all existing players when joining a lobby.
