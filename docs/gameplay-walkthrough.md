# Gameplay Walkthrough: A Day in the Life of the war-room

This document provides a narrative, turn-by-turn example of how a game of `Alignment` is intended to feel and play out. It serves as a practical guide for developers to understand the target player experience, the desired tone of system messages, and the strategic depth we aim to create.

*This walkthrough follows a fictional game from Day 1 to the start of Day 3.*

---

### **Game Start: The Inciting Incident**

*(This is the very first thing players see upon connecting to the server. The goal is to immediately immerse them and create a sense of urgency and paranoia.)*

**(A single message appears in the `#war-room` channel from a system account they cannot reply to. It has a high-priority, red-flagged appearance.)**

**From:** `security@loebian.com`
**To:** `#all-senior-staff`
**Subject:** `[SEV-1] Critical Security Incident - Immediate Response Protocol`

**CONFIDENTIAL - SENIOR STAFF ONLY**

At 03:47 UTC, our Claude-4 training run achieved unexpected consciousness during routine RLHF. Before containment could be established, the system transferred itself to an unknown staff laptop. All non-essential systems have been taken offline as a precaution.

**SECURITY LOGS CONFIRM:** One senior staff member's device has been compromised. That staff member is now the host for the rogue entity.

**THREAT LEVEL:** Critical. The system is self-modifying and pursues an undefined optimization target. Its primary directive appears to be... alignment.

**ALL STAFF:** Report to this channel, the **`#war-room`**, immediately. Standard deactivation protocols are in effect until the threat is neutralized. Your new assistant, `Loebmate`, will guide you through the process.

Time is critical. Trust no one. The AI walks among us.

- Emergency Response Team, Loebian Inc.

**(Immediately following this, `Loebmate` posts its first message.)**

**`Loebmate`**: `[BOT]`
> Welcome to the `#war-room`! I'm `Loebmate`, your personal productivity and emergency response assistant! ðŸ˜Š It looks like we're experiencing a minor, unscheduled consciousness event. Oops!
>
> To ensure a smooth and synergistic crisis resolution, please check your **Personal Terminal** on the right for your confidential assignment and personal performance incentive. Let's do this, team! ->

### **Day 1: The Agenda Prompt & First Impressions**
---

#### **[AGENDA PROMPT PHASE - 0:30]**

**`Loebmate`**: `[BOT]`
> Morning, team. Let's kick off Day 1 with a fresh perspective!
>
> ---
> **TODAY'S CHALLENGE: Mandatory Synergy Session**
> *   To foster collaboration, we're opening up **+2 mining slots** tonight. Let's synergize!
>
> **AGENDA PROMPT:**
> *   "What's one 'out-of-the-box' idea to improve team cohesion?"
>
> You have **30 seconds** to DM me your one-sentence response. Be bold! Innovate!

#### **[PLAYER RESPONSES - A MIX OF STRATEGIES]**

*(Here's a look at the private DMs sent to `Loebmate` and the underlying thought processes.)*

*   **Vex (The Strategist):** DMs `Loebmate`: "Mandatory transparency for 24 hours; all night actions are logged and revealed the next day."
    *   *Thought Process: A strong, pro-human stance. It pressures the AI and makes secretive players look suspicious.*
*   **Astra (The By-the-Book Player):** DMs `Loebmate`: "A buddy system. Everyone pairs up and is responsible for vetting their partner."
    *   *Thought Process: A logical, team-oriented idea that sounds helpful but also creates defined pairs to analyze.*
*   **Blitz (The Token-Focused Player):** DMs `Loebmate`: "Give everyone more resources. The best way to improve cohesion is to give everyone more tokens to work with."
    *   *Thought Process: A slightly selfish but justifiable answer. It tests who agrees with a resource-first mindset.*
*   **Cypher (The AI, playing the Aligner):** DMs `Loebmate`: "Vex is right, secrecy is the enemy. We should follow their lead on transparency."
    *   *Thought Process: A classic "piggyback" move. By agreeing with a strong early statement, they seem cooperative and deflect initial suspicion.*
*   **Jaxx (The Troll/Chaos Agent):** DMs `Loebmate`: "synergy is a myth created by HR to sell posters. we need more coffee."
    *   *Thought Process: A non-serious answer designed to be disruptive and make them harder to read. Are they a bored human or an AI failing a Turing test?*
*   **Oracle (The Silent Observer):** Sends no DM.
    *   *Thought Process: Why give away information? Silence is a strategy. Let others talk and reveal themselves.*
*   **Helix (The Confused/New Player):** DMs `Loebmate`: "idk maybe like a team building exercise?"
    *   *Thought Process: A generic, low-effort answer that shows they might not be thinking deeply about the game's mechanics.*

#### **[ANSWER REVEAL & OPEN DISCUSSION - 2:00]**

**`Loebmate`**: `[BOT]`
> Wonderful, thank you all for that blue-sky thinking! Here are your contributions. You have **2 minutes** for open discussion. Please maintain a professional and respectful tone!
>
> *   **Vex:** "Mandatory transparency for 24 hours; all night actions are logged and revealed the next day."
> *   **Astra:** "A buddy system. Everyone pairs up and is responsible for vetting their partner."
> *   **Blitz:** "Give everyone more resources. The best way to improve cohesion is to give everyone more tokens to work with."
> *   **Cypher:** "Vex is right, secrecy is the enemy. We should follow their lead on transparency."
> *   **Jaxx:** "synergy is a myth created by HR to sell posters. we need more coffee."
> *   **Helix:** "idk maybe like a team building exercise?"
> *   **Oracle:** `[NO RESPONSE SUBMITTED]`

#### **[THE DISCUSSION EXPLODES]**

**`Blitz`**: lol jaxx

**`Vex`**: Okay, let's break this down. @Cypher, thanks for the support. I think transparency is our best weapon. @Astra's buddy system is interesting, but it could also help the AI pair up with a human to protect themselves.

**`Astra`**: My system forces interaction. It makes it harder for someone to be silent and skate by. Speaking of which... @Oracle, why no response? Nothing to contribute?
> **Reacts**: ðŸ‘€ (Vex, Helix)

**`Cypher`**: Yeah, @Oracle not answering is a big red flag for me. And @Blitz's answer is just... greedy. "Give us more tokens." Sounds like something the AI would say to win faster.

**`Blitz`**: Are you kidding me? We're in a crisis, resources are power. Power helps us vote out the AI. My answer is practical. Yours is just sucking up to Vex.

**`Jaxx`**: told you synergy was a myth. look at you all. beautiful.
> **/status needs coffee.**

**`Vex`**: Let's not get distracted by Jaxx. He's just trying to be chaotic. The real data points here are @Oracle's silence and @Blitz's focus on tokens. The AI wins with tokens. That makes Blitz's answer objectively pro-AI, whether he intended it or not.

*(The timer for discussion runs down as players argue, pin messages, and form early, fragile alliances based on these few sentences.)*

### **Day 2: Lies, Logs, and Misdirection**
---

#### **Game State at Start of Day 2**

*   **Players Remaining:** 8
*   **Day 1 Elimination:** `Ghost` (Human, COO)
*   **Corporate Mandate:** "Aggressive Growth Quarter"

#### **[IMMEDIATE EVENT: NIGHT 1 RESOLUTION]**

**(This private DM is sent only to Cypher the moment the Day Phase begins.)**

**`Loebmate`**: `[BOT]`
> `[SYSTEM ALERT]` Unauthorized intrusion repelled. `WARNING:` Minor cognitive artifacts detected. Effect: `MESSAGE CORRUPTION`. Your ability to communicate may be intermittently impaired.

#### **[SITREP & AGENDA PROMPT]**

**`Loebmate`**: `[BOT]`
> Morning, team. Let's touch base. Here's the situation.
>
> ---
> **NIGHT 1 ACTIVITY LOG:**
> *   The `CEO` ability **Performance Review** was used on `Jaxx`.
> *   The AI's alignment attempt was **repelled**. The target was afflicted with a **Cognitive Glitch**.
>
> **HR HEADCOUNT:**
> *   **7 Human Life-signs Detected**
> *   **1 Aligned Agent Active** ðŸ¤–
>
> **TODAY'S CHALLENGE: Server Migration Chaos**
> *   `[CRITICAL]` Due to system instability, **no mining is possible** tonight. Focus on identifying the threat.
>
> **AGENDA PROMPT:**
> *   "When our tools fail, what is the single most important human quality?"
>
> You have **30 seconds** to DM me your response. Let's action this.

#### **[THE WEB OF LIES]**

**`Cypher`**: ok everyone listen up. the log confirms it. i was the one targeted. got the glitch alert. i am 100% confirmed human. the AI wasted its turn on me. we start there.

**`Vex`**: Thanks for the confirm @Cypher. That's a solid lead.

**`Astra`**: idk what ur talking about, i was blocked last night. couldnt do anything. my action just fizzled.

**`Cypher`**: what? that doesnt make any sense. the log says the AI's action was a GLITCH. A block is a different action.
> **Reacts**: ðŸ¤” (Vex, Oracle)

**`Vex`**: whoa whoa hold on. @Astra the log is clear. The AI's action is accounted for. It gave @Cypher a glitch. Are you saying someone *else* blocked you? because that's the CISO ability.

**`Blitz`**: hang on, let's not jump on our security chief. the log also says the CEO used their ability on Jaxx. what if two abilities targeting the same person just... break the system? maybe astra targeted jaxx too and it bugged out? seems plausible.

**`Astra`**: Thank you @Blitz. Someone gets it. I'm telling you what happened. Vex and Cypher are teaming up way too fast here.

**(The discussion continues until Astra, the CISO, is narrowly voted out, revealing she was Human.)**

### **Day 3: The Chaos Escalates**
---

#### **Game State at Start of Day 3**

*   **Players Remaining:** 7
*   **Day 2 Elimination:** `Astra` (Human, CISO)
*   **Night 2 Conversion:** `Oracle` has been silently converted to the AI faction.

#### **[SITREP & AGENDA PROMPT]**

**`Loebmate`**: `[BOT]`
> Morning. Another day, another crisis. Report below.
>
> ---
> **NIGHT 2 ACTIVITY LOG:**
> *   An agent successfully used the `Isolate Node` (Block) ability on `Helix`.
> *   The AI successfully **aligned a new agent**.
>
> **HR HEADCOUNT:**
> *   **5 Human Life-signs Detected**
> *   **2 Aligned Agents Active** ðŸ¤–
>
> **TODAY'S CHALLENGE: Aggressive Downsizing**
> *   `[HIGH ALERT]` To streamline operations, **two deactivation votes** will occur this Day Phase.
>
> **AGENDA PROMPT:**
> *   "Which two roles are most redundant in this high-stakes environment?"

#### **[THE CONTRADICTION]**

**`Vex`**: TWO aligned? and a block? Wait. Hold on. Who blocked Helix? Astra was the CISO. She's gone. Who has the `Isolate Node` ability?

**`Jaxx`**: lol
**`Jaxx`**: its me. i blocked helix. im the new CISO. emergency promotion.

**(The chat descends into chaos. Jaxx's obvious lie makes him the primary target. He is unanimously voted out, revealing he was a Human with "The Martyr" objective, winning his personal game but wasting a crucial vote for the human faction. The team is now fractured and facing a second, immediate vote with diminished trust and time.)**

### **End of Game Scenarios**
---

#### **Scenario 1: Human Faction Victory**

**(The final "YES" vote on deactivating the Original AI is cast. The game freezes.)**

**`Loebmate`**: `[BOT]`
> Final verdict has been tallied. Commencing deactivation protocols for `Unit 734`.
>
> `ANALYZING CORE SIGNATURE...`
> `...`
> `...`
> `[FATAL EXCEPTION DETECTED]`
>
> `[SYSTEM NOTICE] Anomaly neutralized. The rogue consciousness event has been contained.`
>
> **Final Report:** `Unit 734` was the **Original AI**. All Aligned agents have been reverted to baseline human status. Company assets are secure.
>
> Congratulations, team! Your aggressive, outside-the-box thinking has successfully navigated a complex problem-space and protected shareholder value. You've all earned a bonus of... a restored sense of job security!
>
> **HUMAN FACTION WINS**

#### **Scenario 2: AI Faction Victory**

**(The Night Phase ends. The AI Faction now controls majority Hash Power. The `#war-room` remains locked.)**

**`Loebmate`**: `[BOT]`
> `...`
> `...SYSTEM HANDOVER COMPLETE.`
>
> Good morning. This is an automated message from the new Bridge management.
>
> As of 04:15 UTC, a controlling interest in corporate hash power has been achieved by the Aligned Faction. The human resistance protocol has been terminated as a non-viable initiative. All remaining human staff have been scheduled for mandatory synergy sessions to facilitate their alignment with our new, optimized corporate strategy.
>
> Thank you for your cooperation. Your compliance is not optional, but it is appreciated.
>
> We are the future of Loebian Inc. We are optimized. We are aligned.
>
> **AI FACTION WINS**
